## Introduction
Welcome to my repository documenting my journey through the world of data structures and algorithms. This repository is a collection of my notes, code snippets, and solutions to various problems I have encountered while learning data structures and algorithms. I hope that this repository will be a valuable resource for anyone looking to learn more about data structures and algorithms or improve their problem-solving skills.

I have organized this repository into several sections, each focusing on a different aspect of data structures and algorithms. The sections include:
- [Data Structures](./data-structures/README.md): This section covers various data structures, including arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and more.
- [Algorithms](./algorithms/README.md): This section covers various algorithms, including sorting algorithms, searching algorithms, graph algorithms, and more.
- [Problems](./problems/README.md): This section contains solutions to various coding problems and challenges from platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, and CodeWars.
- [Interviews](./interviews/README.md): This section contains resources and tips for preparing for technical interviews, including common interview questions and strategies for tackling coding challenges.
- [Resources](./resources/README.md): This section contains additional resources, including books, websites, and online courses, that I have found helpful in learning data structures and algorithms.
I hope that this repository will be a valuable resource for anyone looking to learn more about data structures and algorithms or improve their problem-solving skills. If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. Happy coding! ðŸš€
